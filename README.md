# Athena
Athena is comming to our school(1337KH) with blessing of god.

# About the project
This project is intended to start a library in 1337Kh sponsored
by students and former students or anyone who believe in our skills
and our potential.

# Why?
42 network have one of the most effective cursus in the world.
the people behind it are smart people and know what they are doing.
while the cursus can teach you about some important technical areas in computer science,
I am sure that it's not enough and 42 knows that. we should learn by ourselves.

With that in mind we think that we need a library where we can discover new things,
learn more and boost our skills making 1337 proud of their students.

The companies will be glad to see a 1.5 year student with too much knowlege about software
architecture and design patterns ...
those skills that a 1337 student would normally learn in the internship.

# What books
There are some highly recommanded books in computer science that are going to be prioritized over other things.

- Design and architecture
	Data structures and algorithms are necessary to write understandable and maintainable code.
	- **clean code**: this book is the most popular book among developers and will help us improve
	readability and testability of your code, which makes a good programmer a good programmer.
	
	- **pragmatic programmer**: time is money, this book will help you do your job in the most
	pragmatic way saving time (it's good for beginners).

	- **Code Complete**: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction: a nice addition
	to The Pragmatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.
	
	- **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software**: this is an introduction to follow
	patterns that all programmers are familiar with.

	- **Refactoring**: you code isn't perfect let's make it better and better.

- Algo and Data Structure
	Algo&DS is so important skills to get some balls to take an interview with FAANG 
	- **Introduction to Algorithms**: uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness.
	The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth.
	- **A common sense guide to data structures and algorithms** a beginner friendly book for algorithms and data structures

	- **The Algorithm Design Manual**: let's take some 1337kh to FAANG.

- Kernel
	We need some students to crack the universe and have no life Maher recommanded those books:
	- **Understanding the linux kernel**: no life;
	- **Linux Device Driver**: no life;
	- **Linux Kernel development**: no life;

- Git
	to became really hard to manage and maintain all the changes and updates of your projects repository. thos same good resources:

	- **A Visual Git Reference** - Mark Lodato
	- **Ry's Git Tutorial** - Ryan Hodson
	- **Git Workflows** - Yan Pritzker
	- **A git Primer** - Daniel Miessler
	- **Git Pocket Guide** - Richard E. Silverman

- Languages
	We learn languages from videos and it's wrong learn from source:
	- **The C programming language**;
	- **Effictive C++**;
	- **Zero To Production In Rust**;
	- **Rust for rustaceans**;
	- **Writing An Interpreter In Go**;
	- **Eloquent javascript**;
	- **You don't know Js**
	- this List is expandable (JS is welcomed ^_^)

# Where is the X book
Fell free to pull request and we will discuss the X book.
