# Athena
Athena is comming to our school ( **1337KH** ) with blessing of God.

<img src="./assets/school_of_athen.jpg">

# About the project
This project is intended to set up a physical library in 1337Kh sponsored
by students and former students or anyone who believes in our skills
and potential.

# Why?
The 42 network has one of the most effective cursus in the world.
The people behind it are smart and know what they are doing.
While the cursus can teach you about some the important technical areas in computer science,
it is not enough, and 42 knows that. We should learn by ourselves.

With that in mind, we believe that we need a library where we can discover new things,
learn more and boost our skills, making 1337 proud of its students.

The companies will be glad to see a 1.5 year student with so much knowlege about software
architecture and design patterns...
Those skills that a 1337 student would normally learn in the internship.

# What books
There are some highly recommended books in computer science that are going to be prioritized over other.
